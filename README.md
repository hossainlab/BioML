# Biomedical Machine Learning with Python (BioML)

## üìò Course Description

**Biomedical Machine Learning with Python (BioML)** is a hands-on, application-driven course designed for early-career researchers, undergraduate students, graduate students, and professionals seeking to understand and implement machine learning (ML) techniques in biomedical research. The course bridges the gap between computational techniques and biomedical data analysis using Python. By integrating real-world biomedical datasets with robust ML pipelines, BioML empowers learners to apply supervised and unsupervised algorithms to tasks such as disease prediction, biomarker discovery, medical image analysis, and patient stratification. The course emphasizes reproducibility, interpretability, and ethical considerations in biomedical ML research.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Understand fundamental concepts of machine learning with a biomedical focus.
- Clean, preprocess, and visualize biomedical datasets using Python libraries.
- Apply classical ML algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, SVM) and evaluate model performance.
- Explore unsupervised learning techniques for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Implement cross-validation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Critically interpret model results in the context of biomedical research.
- Develop reproducible ML workflows using `PyCaret`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- Address ethical, privacy, and fairness issues in biomedical machine learning.
